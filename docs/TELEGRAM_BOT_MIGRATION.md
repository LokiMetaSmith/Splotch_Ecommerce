# Telegram Bot Migration Plan

Based on public information, the `node-telegram-bot-api` package has been flagged for vulnerabilities related to its use of the deprecated `request` package. For enhanced security and maintainability, it is recommended to replace `node-telegram-bot-api` with a modern, well-maintained alternative.

A dedicated task should be created with the following scope:

1.  Identify all projects and services that currently use `node-telegram-bot-api`.
2.  Choose a modern and secure alternative, such as Telegraf or grammY.
3.  Develop a migration plan and timeline for each affected project.
4.  Implement the switch, updating code and testing thoroughly to ensure no loss of functionality.

## Recommended alternatives to `node-telegram-bot-api`

| Feature | Telegraf | grammY |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Why choose it** | An actively maintained, modern framework with a powerful middleware system that makes managing complex bot logic easier. | A library with a strong focus on developer experience, performance, and usability. It features excellent TypeScript support. |
| **Best for** | Building complex bots with features like state management and conversational scenes. | Projects where performance, clean code, and first-class TypeScript support are the highest priority. |
| **API** | Promotes a modular, middleware-based approach that helps organize code as the bot grows in complexity. | Uses an object-oriented approach that is designed to be tidier and easier to comprehend. |
| **Ecosystem** | A well-established library with an active community and a wealth of resources available. | A newer but highly regarded option known for its good tooling and strong developer community. |

## Migration plan for each project

### Preparation:

*   **Assessment:** Identify all code that interacts with `node-telegram-bot-api`. Take note of any custom functions or complex integrations.
*   **Tooling:** Choose a replacement library. If using TypeScript, grammY offers superior type-checking and tooling, while Telegraf is a solid choice for both JavaScript and TypeScript.

### Implementation:

*   **Installation:** Install the new package (e.g., `npm install telegraf`) and remove the old one (`npm uninstall node-telegram-bot-api`).
*   **Code Conversion:**
    *   Familiarize yourself with the new library's syntax and concepts (e.g., Telegraf's middleware).
    *   Update the bot initialization code to use the new library's client.
    *   Convert old `bot.on('message', ...)` or other event handlers to the new library's syntax.
    *   Replace specific API calls, such as sending a message (`bot.sendMessage`), with the new library's equivalent.
    *   Rewrite any complex conversational flows using the new library's features, like Telegraf's middleware scenes.

### Testing:

*   **Comprehensive Testing:** Test all bot commands and features to ensure they function as expected with the new library.
*   **Regression Testing:** Check for any unintended side effects caused by the migration.

### Deployment:

*   **Phased Rollout:** Implement a phased rollout to a testing or staging environment before deploying to production.
*   **Deprecation:** Add a note or a comment in the code to inform future developers that `node-telegram-bot-api` is a deprecated dependency and the current implementation is using a new library.
