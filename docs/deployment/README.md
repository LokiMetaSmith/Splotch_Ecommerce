Welcome to the central deployment documentation for the Print Shop application. This guide will help you choose and execute the deployment strategy that best fits your needs.

There are four primary ways to deploy this application, each with its own guide:

### 1. Local Development

- **Use Case:** For developers contributing to the project. This is the standard way to run the application on your local machine for coding and testing.

### 2. Local Docker Development
