# Using a Reverse Proxy

Using a reverse proxy is highly recommended for deploying this application securely. A reverse proxy sits in front of your web server, handling incoming traffic and providing an additional layer of security and management.

## Why Use a Reverse Proxy?

*   **Security**: A reverse proxy can handle SSL/TLS termination, which means your application server doesn't need to deal with certificates directly. It also hides your application server's IP address and can provide features like rate limiting, IP blocking, and integration with a Web Application Firewall (WAF).
*   **Load Balancing**: If you were to run multiple instances of the application for high availability, a reverse proxy could distribute traffic between them.
*   **Simplified Management**: It allows you to run multiple different web services on the same server, all on the standard ports 80 and 443. The reverse proxy directs traffic to the correct internal application based on the hostname.
*   **Automatic HTTPS**: Modern reverse proxies like Caddy can automatically obtain and renew SSL/TLS certificates for your domains.

As a general rule of thumb, you should expose as few services as necessary to the public internet and use a VPN for internal access whenever possible.

## Recommended Reverse Proxies

Here’s a breakdown of the best options available for self-hosting.

### Caddy

**Caddy is the best choice, especially if you're new to web servers.** It's simpler to configure and has automatic HTTPS built-in.

Its standout feature is **automatic HTTPS**. You just provide your domain names, and Caddy automatically obtains and renews SSL/TLS certificates from Let's Encrypt for you. This feature alone saves a significant amount of time and removes a major hurdle for beginners.

Its configuration file, the `Caddyfile`, is famously simple. To serve this application alongside another one, you just need a few lines.

**Example `Caddyfile`:**

```caddy
your-domain.com {
    # Replace with the port your application is running on
    reverse_proxy localhost:3000
}

# Example for another service
# site2.yourdomain.com {
#     reverse_proxy localhost:8002
# }
```

In this example, Caddy handles all the HTTPS and directs traffic to your application running on port 3000.

### Nginx

Nginx is the industry standard, known for its high performance, stability, and scalability. It can do everything Caddy can and more, but it requires a more hands-on approach.

For HTTPS, you have to manually set up a tool like **Certbot** to get and renew your Let's Encrypt certificates and then configure Nginx to use them.

**Example Nginx config snippet:**

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;

    # Redirect to HTTPS
    location / {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    }
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name your-domain.com;

    # SSL configuration
    # ssl_certificate /path/to/your/fullchain.pem;
    # ssl_certificate_key /path/to/your/privkey.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

### Other Alternatives

*   **Nginx Proxy Manager:** A fantastic option if you want the power of Nginx but with a user-friendly web interface. It runs in a Docker container and lets you configure your reverse proxy and SSL certificates through a simple GUI.
*   **Traefik:** Often used in the context of Docker and Kubernetes, Traefik is a powerful and modern reverse proxy that automatically discovers services. It's very popular for container-based setups but might be overkill for a single application.
